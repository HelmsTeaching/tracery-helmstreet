# Tracery
This is the .json file for my ProcGenjokoan bot. You can find the bot itself here: https://twitter.com/procgenjokoan (source linked in bio)

## Rationale
I made this bot to help me understand two things better: 
1. Dogen
2. Tracery

It surprised me how much it did both. I understood Dogen's sentence structure and mind much better. He loves to think in binaries that undo themselves. To put things in opposition that are not clearly related. We then do the connecting work. Of course, I also learned a lot about tracery and how to find .csv files full of random words!
